Raspberry pi USB serial gadget for Niles 

Install raspbian buster lite on a micro sd card
Download the serial_c and serial_c.service files from this repository on github
Configure the raspberry pi hardware for local login (local monitor, keyboard, and mouse)
Insert the card into the raspberry pi zero and apply power
Log in using pi as the account and raspberry as the password
Enter the following command:  sudo raspi-config
Go to Interfacing Options
Navigate to and select SSH
Choose Yes
Select OK
Choose Finish
Open filezilla and connect to the pi zero using raspberry.local
Copy the serial_c file to the /home/pi directory
Copy the serial_c.service file to the /etc/systemd/system directory
Change directory on the pi zero to /boot
Open the config.txt file with the following command:  sudo nano config.txt
Add the following line  at the end of the file:  dtoverlay=dwc2
Save and exit the file.
Open the cmdline.txt file with the following command:  sudo nano cmdline.txt
Add a space and then the following text after  “rootwait” :   modules-load=dwc2,g_serial
At the command line, enter the following command:  sudo systemctl enable serial_c.service
Verify that it is active by entering the following command:  sudo systemctl status serial_c.service
Shut down the pi zero with the following command:  shutdown –h now
Disconnect the local display, keyboard, and mouse.
Connect the pi zero to a computer using a USB to Micro USB data cable (not a charging cable).  Make sure to plug it into the USB connector on the pi zero and not the power connector (they are labeled.)
Verify that the computer recognizes the pi zero and assigns it a serial port.
Set the baud rate on the assigned serial port on the computer to 38400.  Note that the Niles Intellifile 3 software uses that baud rate.
Open the Intellifile 3 software
